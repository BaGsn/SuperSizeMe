# SuperSizeMe

Super Size Me is a free library under SIL Licence built on the top of [Plumin.js](https://github.com/byte-foundry/plumin.js) and [FontFaceObserver](https://github.com/bramstein/fontfaceobserver) that allow to easily stretch font to the size of its container.

#How to use
To use it, you only need to put your content in a class="workspace" and to apply class="rt" to each text you want to strech.

This version is in really early stage and will evoluate a lot.
